The general "action" system is not quite right. We really ought to separate
that into two things:

  * Combinations, a special kind of action which take exactly one container
    argument, any number of ingredient or ingredient-set arguments, and any
    number of tool arguments, but no other arguments.

    When a combination is invoked, if all the ingredients which are in a
    container are in the same container, then if the container is not
    specified, it is assumed that the same container is being used.

    Rather than List being a generic argument type, lists of ingredients will
    just always be usable as ingredients.

  * Special actions, which only take Text, Mag, or NMag arguments.
