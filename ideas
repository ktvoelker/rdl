Recipe Description Language
===========================

Features
--------
Recipe scaling (some quantities don't scale)
Validity check (not using more of an ingredient than given)
Ingredients exist in a multiple-inheritance heirarchy


Concepts
--------
Units of measure
Ingredients
Containers
Tools
Actions

When ingredients are combined in a container, a new ingredient is formed.
It can be referenced via the container or be given a name.

Actions may take arguments (in Objective C style)
  Arguments are:
    * Single items of type text, num, int, ingredient, container, tool
    * A set of items of any of those types
    * Maybe consumed by the action

Whenever an ingredient may be mentioned, you may mention a subquantity of
that ingredient.

All ingredients must be declared up-front. In those declarations, alternative
ingredients may be given. For the rest of the recipe, the alternatives are
ignored, but at runtime, an alternative may be chosen, and the quantities will
be scaled appropriately.

May give assertions about how much of an ingredient is present.

May define actions as combinations of other actions.
